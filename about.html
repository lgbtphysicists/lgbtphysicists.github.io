His research interests are in experimental nuclear physics, in particular the study of fundamental symmetries through low-energy electron scattering. Deconinck has been a co-organizer of sessions dedicated to gender and sexual diversity in physics at APS March and April meetings since 2011. At the 2012 AAPT/APS physics department chairs conference, Deconinck was invited to discuss issues of gender diversity. Previous efforts by Deconinck and colleagues at the Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Laboratory have led the lab to include sexual orientation and gender identity in the EEO policy, and to extend benefits to same-sex domestic partners.</p></td></tr>

	<p>Michael Falk is an Associate Professor in the departments of Materials Science and Engineering, Mechanical Engineering and Physics and Astronomy at Johns Hopkins University where he devises atomic scale computational methods for understanding non-equilibrium  processes that govern deformation, failure, phase transitions and friction within and between materials.  He also serves as advisor to the GLBT Graduate Students, JHU oSTEM (out in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) and the undergraduate Diverse  Sexuality and Gender Alliance. He advised the student organizers of the 2011 B'More Proud Leadership Summit for which he received a Diversity Recognition Award from Johns Hopkins' Diversity Leadership Council. In 2008 he was presented with the National Organization of Gay and Lesbian Scientific and Technical Professionals (NOGLSTP) Educator Award. In 2012 he worked with this group to organize the first ever session addressing issues of sexual and transgendered minorities in physics at the American Physical Society's March Meeting. <br>Web: <a href="http://materials.jhu.edu/f/mf">http://materials.jhu.edu/f/mf</a></p></td></tr>

	<p>Elena is a Post Doctoral Research Associate at the University of New Hampshire, where she spends her time studying the internal structure of protons and neutrons through spin-polarized electron scattering experiments. Elena hosted the first ever meetings for LGBT+ physicists at an APS meeting beginning in 2010. Following the discussion from those initial meetings, she founded the LGBT+ Physicists website and discussion group. With the help of fellow organizers and with time generously granted by COM/CSWP, they helped to host the 2012 APS March Meeting session on Sexual and Gender Diversity Issues in Physics. Elena continues to be involved in efforts to make the climate in physics more welcoming towards LGBT+ individuals.</p></td></tr>

	<p>Michael Ramsey-Musolf is currently a professor of physics at the University of Massachusetts Amherst and Director of the Amherst Center for Fundamental Interactions. His research concentrates on physics beyond the Standard Model at the interface of nuclear and elementary particle theory with cosmology and astrophysics, with a particular emphasis on the origin of the visible and dark matter of the universe. He also carries out theoretical research in various aspects of quantum chromodynamics. He obtained his Ph.D. from Princeton in 1989, received the 1990 Dissertation Award in Nuclear Physics, and was awarded an NSF Young Investigator grant. He is a fellow of the American Physical Society. Michael was also ordained an Episcopal priest in 1994 and has served in a non-stipendiary capacity at various churches throughout the U.S., with a particular focus on empowerment of at-risk youth. He spoke at the inaugural APS session on Gender and Sexuality Issues in Physics and recently authored an article on the interface of science, faith, and sexuality for the Madison GLBTQ+ monthly Our Lives.

	<p>Projects: Best Practices Guide, OutList, Networking</p>
	<p>Dr. Elizabeth H. Simmons is Professor of Physics in the Michigan State University Department of Physics and Astronomy and Dean of MSU's Lyman Briggs College, a four-year residential undergraduate science college that focuses on the study of science in its historical, philosophical, and sociological context. Simmons is a particle theorist, whose research focuses on the origins of the masses of the elementary subatomic particles, especially the top quark. She is currently studying how physics beyond the Standard Model might manifest itself in experiments in progress at the Large Hadron Collider. She enjoys teaching physics courses at all levels, from introductory to graduate, and is presently teaching mathematical physics to juniors in physics, astronomy, and engineering. Part of her mission as an educator is to encourage students from groups under-represented in physics to consider studies and careers in the physical sciences. After completing her undergraduate degree in physics at Harvard University <i>magna cum laude</i> and being inducted into Phi Beta Kappa, Simmons earned an M.Phil. in physics at Cambridge University as a Churchill Scholar. She returned to Harvard for her doctoral degree and postdoctoral fellowship, and then spent a decade as a professor at Boston University before joining the MSU faculty in summer 2003. She is a Fellow of the AAAS, a Fellow and Outstanding Referee of the American Physical Society, a General Member of the Aspen Center for Physics, and a Trustee of Summer Science Program, Inc. She won the ACE Michigan Network's Distinguished Woman in Higher Education Leadership Award in 2005 and served as a US Delegate to the International Conference on Women in Physics in 2008 (Korea) and 2011 (South Africa).</p></td></tr>
