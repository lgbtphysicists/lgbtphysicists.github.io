	 	<p><h3><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.08406">LGBT+ Inclusivity in Physics and Astronomy: A Best Practices Guide (2nd Ed., 2018)</a></h3></p>
		<p>We present the second edition of a Best Practices Guide for academic departments and other institutions striving to create more inclusive environments for physicists and astronomers in the LGBT+ community. Our recommendations incorporate new research since the original, 2014 edition, and are designed for anyone who wishes to become aware of -- and help mitigate -- the extra burdens that face members of the LGBT+ community in the physical sciences.</p>

		<p><h3><a href="./files/BestPracticesGuide.pdf">Best Practices Guide (1st Ed., 2014)</a></h3></p>
		<p>When physicists talk about issues related to diversity or broadening participation in the field, the focus, thus far, has typically been on creating support mechanisms for women or people of color.  However, physicists who identify as LGBT+ are also a minority within the physics community and can also find themselves marginalized in certain ways.  This document aims to highlight opportunities for making the physics workplace more inclusive for LGBT+ scientists.</p>
		<p>Best practices for the inclusion of LGBT+ people on campus can be found in several places. In the first portion, we limit ourselves to a set of recommendations that are particularly relevant to physicists and physics department chairs (as opposed to general university administrators). After a brief glossary of terms, we make both short-term and long-term department-level suggestions, followed by several recommendations for university-level policies that may guide conversations with institutional administrators. A list of useful external resources is available at the end of the document, along with the author list. Policies that can be implemented rapidly are flagged with stars.</p>

		<p>IGenSpectrum is a student group at UC Berkeley dedicated to improving the visibility and professional preparation of LGBT physicists. Founded in 2014, IGenSpectrum has already hosted a visiting colloquium speaker in a discussion of the challenges facing LGBT scientists; a summer research supplement program for undergraduates; and many social events.</p>

		<p><h3><a href="http://www.campuspride.org/research/">State of Higher Education for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender People -- Campus Pride's 2010 National College Climate Survey</a></h3></p> 
		<p>The State of Higher Education for LGBT People is the most comprehensive national research of its kind to date. The report documents experiences of over 5000 students, faculty, staff and administrators who identify as LGBTQQ at colleges and universities across the United States. Recommendations and findings from the national study provide the means for student activists, campus program planners and policy makers to implement strategic initiatives to address the needs and concerns of their LGBTQQ students and employees.</p>

		<p><h3><a href="http://www.ucl.ac.uk/support-pages/lgb">University College London's LGBT Student Support Pages</a></h3></p> 
		<p>Being a student, whether an undergraduate or postgraduate, can be a stressful time. LGBT students may have additional concerns, such as worries about coming out, or reconciling their sexuality with their identity and/or gender.</p>
		<p>Some students don't think of themselves as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender but can be confused to find themselves attracted to someone of the same sex and/or confused if their gender expression is different to that expected of their genetic sex. These issues can be difficult to discuss with friends and family.</p>
		<p>This website is designed to help with some of these issues and worries. There are information pages of various common concerns among LGBT students, or those questioning their sexuality and/or gender identity.</p>
