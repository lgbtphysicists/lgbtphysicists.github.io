	 <h3><p><a href="http://www.aps.org/meetings/march/events/lgbt.cfm">LGBT Roundtable Discussion</a><br>
	Wednesday, March 5th, 2014<br>
	6:00pm - 7:00pm<br>
	Denver, CO<br>
    	Sheraton Denver Downtown, Governer's Square 11<br></h3>
	 </p>
	 <p>The LGBT+ Physicists group welcomes those who identify as gender sexual minorities, as LGBTQQIAAP+, or as allies to participate in a round-table discussion on mentoring physicists. The session will provide an opportunity to learn and discuss successful mentoring strategies at different career stages for physicists in all environments, including academia, industry, etc. Attendees are encouraged to attend a social event to follow the panel to continue to network. Allies are especially welcome at this event to learn how to support and mentor LGBT+ physicists. </p>
	<p>Our session will unfortunately overlap with <a href="http://www.aps.org/meetings/march/events/nsbp.cfm">that of the National Society of Black Physicists (NSBP)</a>; however, they will be meeting right next door to us at the Sheraton. Attendees are encouraged to freely move between the two sessions as they wish.  Attendees are also encouraged to attend the <a href="http://www.aps.org/meetings/march/events/com-cswp.cfm">Diversity Session</a> following both sessions.</p>
	<p>We welcome everyone to attend!  Light refreshments will be provided.</p>
	<p>We gratefully thank <a href="http://www.aps.org/programs/minorities/">COM</a>, <a href="http://www.aps.org/programs/women/">CSWP</a>, <a href="http://www.ostem.org/">oSTEM</a>, <a href="http://www.nsbp.org/">NSBP</a> and <a href="http://www.aps.org/">APS</a> for their kind sponsorship and support of this event.</p>

	Salon VII-VII</h3>   
	 </p>
	 <p>Currently there is extremely little in the way of resources for LGBT+ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex, queer, questioning, asexual, pansexual, etc.) physicists. This meeting will be an open conversation to continue creating these resources. The session is open to both LGBT+ physicists as well as straight and cisgender people who are interested in helping those who are not.<br>
<br>
Some topics that will be on the discussion floor:<br>
<br>
    &middot; Lack of employment protections on the basis of sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression<br>
    &middot; Lack of data on the LGBT+ physicist demographics<br>
    &middot; Health insurance policies that cover domestic partners<br>
    &middot; Transgender related health care<br>
    &middot; "2010 State of Higher Education for LGBT People" - Campus Pride<br>

	 </p>
	 <p>The workshop presenter has been working on creating resources for LGBTIQQAP+ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex, queer, questioning, asexual, pansexual, etc.) Physicists. Although much is still in the beginning phases, progress is being made to make physics more trans friendly such as changing EEO policies and attempting to gather data on our demographics. This workshop is an opportunity to have a conversation with trans folk working in science to discuss ways in which we can make the different fields of science more trans friendly.
