	 	<p><h3><a href="./files/BestPracticesGuide.pdf">Best Practices Guide</a></h3></p>
		<p>When physicists talk about issues related to diversity or broadening participation in the field, the focus, thus far, has typically been on creating support mechanisms for women or people of color.  However, physicists who identify as LGBT+ are also a minority within the physics community and can also find themselves marginalized in certain ways.  This document, written by <span style="color:#FE2EF7"><b>lgbt+</span><span style="color:#000000">physicists</a></b> and WGLE, aims to highlight opportunities for making the physics workplace more inclusive for LGBT+ scientists.</p>
		<p>Best practices for the inclusion of LGBT+ people on campus can be found in several places. In the first portion, we limit ourselves to a set of recommendations that are particularly relevant to physicists and physics department chairs (as opposed to general university administrators). After a brief glossary of terms, we make both short-term and long-term department-level suggestions, followed by several recommendations for university-level policies that may guide conversations with institutional administrators. A list of useful external resources is available at the end of the document, along with the author list. Policies that can be implemented rapidly are flagged with stars.</p>

		<p><h3><a href="http://www.aps.org/programs/lgbt/">APS Page on LGBT Physicists</b></a></h3></p> 
		<p>From 2015-2016, the APS formed an ad hoc Committee on LGBT Issues (C-LGBT) to "Advise the APS on the current status of LGBT issues in physics, provide recommendations for greater inclusion, and engage physicists in laying the foundation for a more inclusive physics community. More specifically, the committee will investigate LGBT representation in physics, assess the educational and professional climate in physics, recommend changes in policies and practices that impact LGBT physicists, and address other issues that affect inclusion." <a href="http://www.aps.org/programs/lgbt/upload/LGBTClimateInPhysicsReport.pdf">C-LGBT released a report titled "LGBT Climate in Physics"</a>, which included a number of findings in the climate of physics and provided recommendations to the APS on ways to make a more inclusive physics community.</p>

	 </p>
	 <p>The National Organization of Gay and Lesbian Scientists and Technical Professionals, NOGLSTP, is a membership-based professional society of gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender people - and their allies - employed or interested in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields. NOGLSTP educates people on LGBT issues in science and the technical workplace, and fosters mentoring and networking among its members.

	 <p><h3><a href="http://www.ostem.org/">oSTEM: Out in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics</a></h3>
	 </p>
	 <p>oSTEM is an orgazation on a few different campuses around the United States whose mission is to provide services and support for students of sciences, technology, engineering, and mathematics, create a dynamic network between students and professionals in industry and academia, provide education, outreach, and professional resources to high school students, and actively recruit and address the needs of diverse groups within the LGBTA community, inclusive of those who are historically underrepresented with regards to gender and ethnic background.
